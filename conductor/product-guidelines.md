# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
Our communication should be **friendly**, approachable, and conversational. We want our users to feel welcomed and supported, using a warm tone that builds trust while remaining helpful and informative.

## Visual Identity and Branding
The project follows a unique blend of **Minimalist**, **Dark Mode Primary**, and **Vibrant** aesthetics:
- **Minimalist Layouts:** We prioritize clean whitespace and simple, effective typography to reduce cognitive load.
- **Dark Mode First:** The primary interface is designed for low-light environments with high-contrast elements.
- **Vibrant Accents:** We use bold, energetic colors for interactive elements and key highlights to provide visual interest and clear feedback.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Performance First:** Speed is a feature. We optimize for low latency and fast load times in every aspect of the application.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Users should receive immediate and clear visual responses to their actions.

## Documentation Standards
- **Detailed and Comprehensive:** Documentation must be thorough, explaining not just the "how" but also the "why" behind features and architectural decisions.
- **Structured Clarity:** Use clear headings, lists, and cross-references to make navigating deep information intuitive.
